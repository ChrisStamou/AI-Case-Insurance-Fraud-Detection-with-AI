# AI-Case-Insurance-Fraud-Detection-with-AI
AI business case project: detecting fraudulent vehicle insurance claims using synthetic data (5,000 claims). Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were built in Python (scikit-learn) to rank claims by fraud risk. At a 25% review capacity, Logistic Regression improved investigator efficiency by 3.3Ã— while still catching ~80% of fraud cases.
